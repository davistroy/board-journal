      "answer": "Flutter with Drift ORM",
      "details": "Use Flutter as the mobile framework with Drift (formerly Moor) as the ORM for SQLite database operations. Flutter provides cross-platform development with native performance, and Drift is the recommended ORM for Flutter SQLite integration.",

      "answer": "Minimal 3-screen onboarding",
      "details": "Implement a minimal onboarding flow: Welcome screen with value proposition, Privacy/terms acceptance screen, then direct to OAuth sign-in followed by first entry experience. Keep onboarding brief to reduce friction.",

      "answer": "Defer Setup—allow journaling without it",
      "details": "Allow users to start journaling immediately without completing Setup. Prompt for Setup after 3-5 entries when users have enough context to define meaningful problems. This reduces onboarding friction while ensuring Setup happens when it's most valuable.",

      "answer": "In-app prompts only for MVP",
      "details": "Remove push notification from bet tracking for MVP. Rely on in-app prompts and the Home screen bet status display. This resolves the inconsistency with Section 2.2 which lists reminders/notifications as out of scope.",

      "answer": "Manual re-extraction with smart prompt",
      "details": "Do not auto-re-extract when transcript is edited. Show a prompt like 'Transcript updated. Re-extract signals?' to give users control over when extraction runs. This avoids disrupting intentional signal edits from minor transcript corrections.",

      "answer": "Overwrite with warning and diff",
      "details": "Overwrite manual edits when re-extraction runs, but show a warning first with a diff view so users can see what will change. This maintains consistency between transcript and signals while giving users visibility into the impact.",
