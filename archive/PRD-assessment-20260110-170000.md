# Document Assessment: PRD v4 — Boardroom Journal (MVP)

**Assessment Date:** January 10, 2026
**Document Version/Date:** PRD v4, Jan 10, 2026
**Assessor:** Claude (Automated Review)

---

## Executive Summary

PRD v4 represents a **comprehensive and well-structured product requirements document** that has addressed virtually all of the gaps identified in previous assessments. The document now includes complete technical architecture specifications, data architecture, security requirements, privacy policies, error handling patterns, and accessibility requirements. The 90-question assessment process has successfully transformed this from a feature specification into a production-ready technical blueprint.

The document excels in its detailed workflow state machines, clear role definitions, and explicit handling of edge cases. The addition of sections on offline behavior, testing strategy, analytics, and accessibility demonstrates mature product thinking. The glossary provides clear definitions for domain-specific terminology, reducing ambiguity.

The remaining issues are relatively minor—primarily opportunities to further clarify implementation details, add a few missing edge cases, and ensure complete internal consistency after the extensive updates.

- **Well-defined state machines**: All workflows have explicit states, transitions, and edge case handling
- **Clear glossary**: Domain terms (comfort work, receipts, appreciating/depreciating) well explained
- **Accessibility requirements**: VoiceOver/TalkBack, WCAG 2.1 AA, alternative input methods
- **Testing strategy**: Coverage targets, AI validation layers, and test infrastructure
- **Analytics with privacy**: Events tracked without PII, opt-out available
- **Offline-first design**: Clear feature matrix and sync behavior

---

## High Priority Issues

### H1. Mobile Framework Not Specified

**Location:** Section 3A.2 (Backend Architecture), 3B.1 (Local Storage)
**Impact:** Development team cannot begin until framework is chosen; affects all technical decisions

The document references "Flutter" and "React Native" as examples for ORM choices but does not commit to a mobile framework. This affects:
- Which ORM to use (Drift/Moor vs WatermelonDB)
- UI component libraries
- Native module approach
- Testing framework selection

**Recommendation:** Add a "Mobile Framework" decision to locked assumptions or Technical Architecture section. Specify the chosen framework (Flutter recommended based on ORM mentions) and rationale.

---

### H2. Onboarding Flow Not Defined

**Location:** Missing entirely
**Impact:** First-run experience is critical for retention; currently unspecified

The document references displaying privacy statements and third-party disclosures "during onboarding" but doesn't define the onboarding flow itself:
- What screens does a new user see?
- Is Setup required immediately or deferred?
- How is the value proposition communicated?
- What's the minimum viable first session?

**Recommendation:** Add Section 5.0 "Onboarding Flow" before Home screen, defining:
- First-launch sequence
- Privacy/terms acceptance
- Optional quick tour
- Deferred vs immediate Setup
- First entry experience

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### M1. Push Notifications Listed as Out-of-Scope but Referenced in Bet Tracking

**Location:** Section 2.2 (out-of-scope) vs Section 4.6 (Bet Tracking)
**Impact:** Inconsistency could cause implementation confusion

Section 2.2 states "Reminders/notifications" are out of scope for MVP. However, Section 4.6 specifies "On due date: Push notification" for bet expiration.

**Recommendation:** Either:
1. Remove push notification from bet expiration and rely on in-app prompts only, OR
2. Clarify that bet expiration notifications ARE in MVP scope (exception to general rule)

---

### M2. Claude Model Version Not Specified

**Location:** Section 3A.1 (AI/LLM Provider Strategy)
**Impact:** Model capabilities and pricing vary significantly by version

The document specifies "Claude (Anthropic)" but not which model (Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, Opus, or future versions). This affects:
- Cost estimates
- Context window limits
- Response quality expectations
- Latency targets

**Recommendation:** Specify model tier (e.g., "Claude 3.5 Sonnet for MVP, evaluate Haiku for cost optimization post-launch") and rationale.

---

### M3. Weekly Brief Generation Trigger When No Entries Exist

**Location:** Section 4.2 (Weekly Brief Generation)
**Impact:** Edge case not handled

What happens if Sunday 8pm arrives but the user has zero entries for the week? Options:
- Generate a brief saying "No entries this week"
- Skip generation entirely
- Generate a reminder to make entries

**Recommendation:** Add explicit behavior for zero-entry weeks. Suggested: Skip generation, show "No entries this week" placeholder in Weekly Brief section.

---

### M4. Problem Deletion/Modification After Setup

**Location:** Section 4.4 (Setup State Machine)
**Impact:** Users may need to adjust portfolio without full re-setup

The document describes Setup and re-setup but doesn't address:
- Can users edit individual problems without full re-setup?
- Can users delete a problem (going from 5 to 4)?
- What happens to board anchoring if an anchored problem is removed?

**Recommendation:** Add "Portfolio Modification" subsection clarifying:
- Individual problem editing (allowed/not allowed)
- Problem deletion rules
- Impact on board anchoring

---

### M5. Entry Editing After Extraction

**Location:** Section 4.1 (Daily Journal Entry), Section 5.3 (Entry Review)
**Impact:** Data flow unclear when user edits after AI processing

If a user edits an entry after extraction has completed:
- Are signals automatically re-extracted?
- Is manual re-extraction required?
- What if the user edited signals directly—do those persist?

**Recommendation:** Clarify the editing flow:
- Transcript edit → auto-re-extract vs manual trigger
- Signal edit → preserve vs overwrite on re-extraction
- Entry locking after N days (if any)

---

### M6. Quarterly Report Frequency Enforcement

**Location:** Section 4.5 (Quarterly Report)
**Impact:** "Quarterly" suggests 4x/year but enforcement unclear

The document doesn't specify:
- Is there a minimum time between quarterly reports?
- Can users run quarterly reports weekly if desired?
- How does the system know when a "quarter" ends?

**Recommendation:** Define quarterly report eligibility rules (e.g., "Available every 90 days from last quarterly, or at Setup completion, or on-demand with warning if <30 days since last").

---

## Low Priority Issues

### L1. Settings Screen Missing "About" Section

**Location:** Section 5.9 (Settings)
**Impact:** Standard app section missing

Settings doesn't include typical "About" content:
- App version
- Terms of service link
- Privacy policy link
- Support/feedback link
- Open source licenses

**Recommendation:** Add "About" subsection to Settings with standard links and version info.

---

### L2. History Screen Not Detailed

**Location:** Section 5.1 (Home) references "History (Entries / Reports)"
**Impact:** History functionality unspecified

The History screen is mentioned but not defined:
- How are entries listed (chronological, grouped by week)?
- Search/filter capabilities?
- How are reports (Quick Version, Setup, Quarterly) organized?

**Recommendation:** Add Section 5.10 "History" defining list views, sorting, filtering, and search.

---

### L3. Tablet/Large Screen Layout Not Addressed

**Location:** Throughout UX section
**Impact:** iPad/tablet users may have suboptimal experience

The document is written for mobile phone form factor. Considerations for tablets:
- Master-detail layouts
- Side-by-side editing
- Larger text defaults

**Recommendation:** Add brief note in Section 5 header: "MVP targets phone form factor; tablet layouts optimized post-MVP."

---

### L4. Dark Mode Not Mentioned

**Location:** Throughout
**Impact:** Common user expectation not addressed

No mention of dark mode support, which is:
- Expected by many users
- Required for OLED battery optimization
- Accessibility consideration (light sensitivity)

**Recommendation:** Add to either locked assumptions ("Light mode only for MVP") or scope ("Dark mode: post-MVP").

---

### L5. Haptic Feedback Patterns Undefined

**Location:** Section 12.3 mentions haptic feedback
**Impact:** Minor UX consistency issue

Haptics are mentioned as "optional, can disable" but specific patterns not defined:
- Recording start/stop
- Save confirmation
- Error states
- Navigation

**Recommendation:** Add brief haptic pattern guide or defer: "Haptic patterns defined during implementation."

---

### L6. Entry Character/Word Limits Not Specified

**Location:** Section 4.1 (Daily Journal Entry)
**Impact:** Could affect storage and AI processing costs

No maximum length for:
- Voice recording duration
- Transcript length
- Follow-up answers

**Recommendation:** Add limits: e.g., "Max 10 minutes per recording (~1500 words), max 5000 words per entry including follow-ups."

---

### L7. Soft Limit Enforcement Details

**Location:** Section 3A.1 (Rate Limits)
**Impact:** "Soft limit" behavior needs clarification

Rate limits are described as "soft" with "usage visibility" but:
- What happens when limit is exceeded?
- Warning before limit reached?
- Reset timing (midnight local? rolling 24h?)

**Recommendation:** Add soft limit UX behavior: warnings, exceeded state, reset timing.

---

### L8. Brief Export Format Details

**Location:** Section 5.4 (Weekly Brief Viewer)
**Impact:** Export format not fully specified

Markdown and JSON export mentioned but:
- Markdown template/structure?
- JSON schema?
- Include metadata (date, entry count)?

**Recommendation:** Add export format specifications or note: "Export formats defined in implementation."

---

## Missing Content

The following would strengthen the document but are not blockers:

1. **Onboarding flow** (see H2)
2. **History screen details** (see L2)
3. **Error message catalog** - comprehensive list of all user-facing messages
4. **Prompt templates** - actual LLM prompts for key workflows
5. **Animation/transition specs** - loading states, transitions between screens
6. **Sound design** - recording start/stop sounds, notification sounds
7. **App icon and branding** - visual identity requirements
8. **App Store listing content** - description, screenshots, keywords

---

## Structural Recommendations

The document structure is strong. Minor improvements:

1. **Number all sections consistently** - Current mix of "3A", "3B" etc. works but consider "3.7", "3.8" for cleaner hierarchy
2. **Add internal links** - Cross-reference related sections (e.g., "See Section 4.6 for bet status details")
3. **Create a quick-reference appendix** - One-page summary of key numbers (limits, timeouts, thresholds)
4. **Add changelog** - Track document version history and major changes
