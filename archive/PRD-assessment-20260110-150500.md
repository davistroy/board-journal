# Document Assessment: PRD.md (Boardroom Journal MVP)

**Assessment Date:** January 10, 2026
**Document Version/Date:** January 9, 2026 (v3)
**Assessor:** Claude (Automated Review)

## Executive Summary

The PRD v3 for Boardroom Journal is a well-structured and ambitious document that clearly articulates a voice-first journaling app with an AI-powered "board of directors" governance system. The document demonstrates strong product thinking with detailed state machines, clear acceptance criteria, and thoughtful consideration of user experience flows. The locked assumptions and explicit scope boundaries show mature product discipline.

However, the document has significant gaps in technical implementation details that would block engineering from starting work. There is no mention of the underlying LLM/AI provider strategy, no data model schema, no API specifications, and no error handling patterns beyond basic recovery states. The document also contains internal inconsistencies in board role counts (sometimes "5-7", sometimes specific counts that don't match) and leaves several critical decisions explicitly unresolved with "[NEED INPUT]" markers.

The strongest aspects are the detailed state machines for each workflow, the clear governance role definitions with anchoring mechanisms, and the comprehensive acceptance criteria. The weakest aspects are the missing technical architecture, incomplete privacy/compliance details, and gaps in offline/sync behavior specifications.

---

## Critical Issues

### C1. No AI/LLM Provider Strategy

**Location:** Entire document (missing)
**Impact:** Cannot begin technical architecture or estimate costs

The document describes an AI-heavy application with transcription, extraction, summarization, and conversational governance flows, but never specifies:
- Which LLM provider(s) will be used (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- Which speech-to-text service for transcription
- Whether to use cloud APIs or on-device models
- Token/cost considerations
- Latency requirements for real-time transcription
- Fallback strategies if AI services are unavailable

**Recommendation:** Add a "Technical Architecture" section specifying:
- Primary LLM provider and model(s) for each use case
- Speech-to-text provider (Whisper, Deepgram, AssemblyAI, etc.)
- Cost estimation per user per month
- Offline/degraded mode behavior
- Rate limiting strategy

---

### C2. No Data Persistence or Sync Strategy

**Location:** Section 3 (Information Architecture) - partial only
**Impact:** Cannot design database schema or handle multi-device scenarios

The document defines data objects conceptually but lacks:
- Database technology choice (SQLite local, cloud database, both)
- Sync strategy for multiple devices
- Conflict resolution approach
- Data migration strategy for schema changes
- Backup/restore functionality
- Maximum storage limits per user

**Recommendation:** Add a "Data Architecture" section specifying:
- Local vs. cloud storage decisions
- Sync protocol (if multi-device supported)
- Schema versioning approach
- Storage quotas and limits

---

### C3. Privacy Policy Content Not Provided

**Location:** Section 6.4, Line 567 - marked as "[NEED INPUT]"
**Impact:** Blocks compliance review, App Store submission, and user trust

The document acknowledges this gap with "[NEED INPUT] privacy statement wording" but this is a critical blocker for:
- GDPR/CCPA compliance determination
- App Store privacy nutrition labels
- User consent flows
- Data retention policies

**Recommendation:** Provide specific privacy policy statements covering:
- Data never used to train AI models (if true)
- Third-party data sharing policies
- Data retention periods
- User data export rights
- Jurisdiction and data residency

---

## High Priority Issues

### H1. Board Role Count Inconsistency

**Location:** Multiple sections (3.3, 4.4, 4.5)
**Impact:** Confusion about implementation requirements

The document inconsistently references board roles:
- Section 3.3.1: "7 board roles (5 core + 2 growth)"
- BoardMember object (Line 58): "x5-7"
- Section 4.4 State 6-7: "Create Core Board Roles (5)" and "Create Growth Board Roles (0-2)"
- Various places: "5-7 board members"

The math works (5 + 0-2 = 5-7), but the document sometimes says "7 board roles" as if all are always present, other times correctly notes the conditional nature.

**Recommendation:** Standardize language throughout: "5 core roles (always active) + 2 growth roles (conditional on appreciating problems)"

---

### H2. No Error Handling Patterns

**Location:** Section 4 (State Machines)
**Impact:** Unknown behavior in failure scenarios

Each state machine mentions an "Error / Recovery" state but never defines:
- What errors trigger this state
- Recovery procedures for each error type
- User messaging for errors
- Retry logic specifications
- Data preservation during errors

**Recommendation:** Add an "Error Handling" section defining:
- Common error types per workflow
- Recovery procedures
- User-facing error messages
- Retry/resume capabilities

---

### H3. No API/Backend Specification

**Location:** Entire document (missing)
**Impact:** Cannot begin backend development

For a mobile app requiring authentication, storage, and AI processing, there is no mention of:
- API endpoints and contracts
- Authentication token management
- Backend service architecture
- Serverless vs. server-based approach
- API versioning strategy

**Recommendation:** Add a "Backend Architecture" section or reference a separate technical spec document.

---

### H4. Transcription Failure Handling Incomplete

**Location:** Section 5.2, Lines 416-418
**Impact:** Poor user experience when transcription fails

The acceptance criteria states "If transcription fails, user can retry or save raw notes as text" but doesn't clarify:
- What happens to the audio if transcription fails?
- Is there an audio retention option for failed transcriptions?
- Can users manually type instead of voice in case of repeated failures?
- What triggers a transcription failure vs. retry?

**Recommendation:** Expand failure handling to cover:
- Audio retention policy for failed transcriptions
- Manual text entry fallback
- Partial transcription handling
- Network failure vs. service failure differentiation

---

### H5. OAuth Implementation Details Missing

**Location:** Section 2.1, Line 33
**Impact:** Cannot implement authentication flow

"OAuth sign-in: Apple / Google / Microsoft" lacks:
- Account linking strategy (what if user signs in with different providers?)
- Session management approach
- Token refresh handling
- Account deletion flow (required for App Store)
- Migration between auth providers

**Recommendation:** Add authentication section covering:
- Provider-specific requirements (Apple requires support if other social logins exist)
- Account linking rules
- Session timeout/refresh policies
- Account deletion implementation

---

### H6. Sensitivity Gate Undefined

**Location:** Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 (State 0 in multiple state machines)
**Impact:** Cannot implement first state of governance workflows

Multiple state machines reference "State 0: Sensitivity Gate" but never define:
- What this gate checks for
- What triggers a sensitivity flag
- User flow when sensitivity is detected
- How sensitivity interacts with the "abstracted" mode mentioned in 6.4

**Recommendation:** Define the Sensitivity Gate including:
- Trigger conditions
- User prompts/warnings
- Data handling in sensitive mode
- Relationship to abstraction mode

---

### H7. Weekly Brief "Micro-Review" Undefined

**Location:** Section 4.2, State 5; Section 5.4
**Impact:** Cannot implement optional feature

The document references "Optional Micro-Review" and "Board Micro-Review" but never defines:
- What content is in this micro-review
- How it differs from the full quarterly report
- When/why users would want it
- Format and length constraints

**Recommendation:** Define the micro-review format, content, and purpose, or remove it from MVP scope.

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### M1. "Streaming or Post" Transcription Ambiguity

**Location:** Section 4.1, State 3
**Impact:** Unclear technical requirement

"Transcribing (streaming or post)" suggests two approaches but doesn't specify:
- When to use streaming vs. post-processing
- User experience differences between approaches
- Technical requirements for each

**Recommendation:** Decide on one approach for MVP or clearly specify when each is used.

---

### M2. Time Allocation Validation Rules Unclear

**Location:** Section 4.4, Line 301
**Impact:** Edge case handling unknown

"Time allocations sum to approximately 100%" - what is "approximately"?
- Acceptable range (95-105%? 90-110%?)
- Error handling if sum is outside range
- Rounding display rules

**Recommendation:** Specify exact acceptable range and behavior when sum is outside range.

---

### M3. Extracted Signals Definition Incomplete

**Location:** Section 4.1 (Line 203)
**Impact:** Cannot implement extraction logic

"Must store extractedSignals (best-effort)" but the definition is spread across document:
- Line 196: "wins, blockers, risks, avoided decision, comfort work"
- Line 423: "wins/blockers/risks/avoided decision/comfort work/actions"

The second list includes "actions" which the first doesn't. Needs consolidation.

**Recommendation:** Create single authoritative list of extracted signals with definitions.

---

### M4. Board Persona Customization Scope Unclear

**Location:** Section 3.3.5, Lines 127-128
**Impact:** Cannot design settings UI

"Users can edit persona names and profiles in Settings" but:
- Can users change the persona completely?
- What fields are editable?
- Can users reset to defaults?
- Are there character/length limits?

**Recommendation:** Specify editable fields, constraints, and reset capability.

---

### M5. Weekly Brief "Regen Options" Implementation Unclear

**Location:** Section 4.2, Line 231
**Impact:** Cannot implement regeneration UI

"Regen options: 'shorter', 'more actionable', 'more strategic'" but:
- Are these mutually exclusive?
- Can they be combined?
- How many regenerations are allowed?
- What does each option actually change in the prompt?

**Recommendation:** Define regeneration option behavior and limits.

---

### M6. "Comfort Work" Definition Missing

**Location:** Multiple sections
**Impact:** Users may not understand the term

The term "comfort work" is used throughout but never defined. Users may not understand what this means or how to identify it in their work.

**Recommendation:** Add a glossary defining key terms including "comfort work", "appreciating/depreciating problems", "receipts", etc.

---

### M7. Device Timezone Handling Incomplete

**Location:** Section 1 (Locked assumptions), Line 9
**Impact:** Edge cases in timezone changes

"Sunday 8:00pm local (use device timezone; America/New_York default)" but:
- What if user travels across timezones?
- What if device timezone changes mid-week?
- Is the default for users who haven't granted location permission?

**Recommendation:** Specify timezone change handling and default fallback conditions.

---

### M8. Portfolio Version Management Unclear

**Location:** Section 3.1, Line 57
**Impact:** Cannot implement portfolio history

"ProblemPortfolio: ... version, updatedAt" suggests versioning but:
- Is version history preserved?
- Can users view/restore previous versions?
- How do version changes affect board anchoring?

**Recommendation:** Clarify version history retention and usage.

---

### M9. Bet Status Values Undefined

**Location:** Section 3.1, Line 61
**Impact:** Cannot implement bet tracking

"Bet: ... status" but valid status values are not defined. Presumably includes:
- Open/pending
- Verified correct
- Verified wrong
- Expired/not evaluated

**Recommendation:** Define explicit status enum values and transition rules.

---

## Low Priority Issues

### L1. Hard Cap Override Statement Contradictory

**Location:** Line 10
**Impact:** Minor confusion

"Daily entry cap: hard cap 3/day, no override" - if there's no override, why mention it? The phrasing is redundant.

**Recommendation:** Simplify to "Daily entry cap: 3/day maximum"

---

### L2. Silence Timeout Left as [NEED INPUT]

**Location:** Section 4.1, Line 188
**Impact:** Minor implementation delay

The silence timeout is explicitly marked as needing input with an assumed default of 8 seconds. This should be resolved but is not blocking.

**Recommendation:** Confirm or adjust the 8-second default.

---

### L3. Skip Vagueness Gate Decision Pending

**Location:** Section 5.6, Lines 468-469
**Impact:** UX decision needed

"Optional: allow two-step skip but record 'refused example'" should be decided before implementation.

**Recommendation:** Make a decision and document it as a locked assumption.

---

### L4. Export "Share Sheet" Platform Specificity

**Location:** Section 2.1, Line 42
**Impact:** Minor ambiguity

"Markdown export (share sheet)" uses iOS terminology. Android uses "share intent". Clarify cross-platform expectations.

**Recommendation:** Use platform-neutral language or specify per-platform behavior.

---

### L5. "One-Page" Brief Definition

**Location:** Multiple sections
**Impact:** Minor ambiguity

"One-page executive brief" - one page at what font size/screen size? Consider specifying word count or character limit instead.

**Recommendation:** Replace "one-page" with specific length constraint (e.g., "max 500 words").

---

### L6. Quarterly Report vs. Board Report Terminology

**Location:** Sections 4.5, 5.8, 7
**Impact:** Minor terminology inconsistency

Document uses both "Quarterly Board Report" and "Quarterly Report" interchangeably. Should standardize.

**Recommendation:** Pick one term and use consistently throughout.

---

## Structural Recommendations

1. **Add a "Technical Requirements" major section** after Section 6 to cover LLM provider, data architecture, and security before the acceptance criteria summary.

2. **Move "Locked Assumptions" to its own section** rather than embedding it at the top. It's easily missed and important enough to warrant its own numbered section.

3. **Create a Glossary section** early in the document (after Product Definition) to define domain-specific terms that readers may not understand.

4. **Consolidate "[NEED INPUT]" items** into a single "Open Decisions" section rather than scattering them throughout. This makes it easier to track resolution.

5. **Add cross-references between related sections** - for example, the Board Role Definitions (3.3) should reference where they're used in state machines (4.4, 4.5).

6. **Consider splitting into multiple documents**:
   - Product Requirements (current focus)
   - Technical Architecture Specification
   - UI/UX Specification (wireframes)

   This would reduce document length and allow parallel development.
