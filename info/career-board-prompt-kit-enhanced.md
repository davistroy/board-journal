# Career Board Prompt Kit (Enhanced)

**Designed to catch drift early, protect what's working, and surface opportunities—by forcing receipts and decisions.**

## What's Different in This Version

This enhanced version incorporates findings from psychological research on accountability, implementation intentions, and board effectiveness:

| Enhancement | Research Basis | Purpose |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **Portfolio Defender role** | Feedback research shows purely critical input undermines motivation | Protects appreciating skills from neglect |
| **Opportunity Scout role** | Career support frameworks identify opportunity-scanning as distinct function | Forward-looking, not just retrospective |
| **Flexible role count (5-7)** | Board composition research recommends 4-7 members | Scales to portfolio complexity |
| **Re-Setup Triggers** | Implementation intentions work best with specific conditions | Prevents stale board anchoring |
| **Portfolio Health Score** | Commitment devices work better with measurable states | Quantifies drift risk |

## Start where you are:

- **15 minutes to test** → Quick Version
- **Set up the system** → Setup
- **Running quarterly** → The Quarterly
- **Annual refresh** → Re-Setup

---

## Quick Version

Use this first. If it surfaces something, consider the full setup.

```
You are running a 15-minute career audit. Ask ONE question at a time. Wait for my answer.

Rule: If my answer is vague, stop and ask for one concrete example before continuing.

BEFORE WE START: Any sensitive details? If yes, I'll use abstractions ("my manager," "the Q2 project").

1. What do I do? (Role, context–2 sentences)

2. Name 3 problems I'm paid to solve–not tasks, but problems where my judgment matters.

3. For each problem, ask:
   - Is AI making this faster/cheaper to produce?
   - Is the cost of getting it wrong rising or falling?
   - Does it require trust, judgment, or context that doesn't transfer easily?

Then output:
| Problem | AI cheaper? | Error cost? | Trust required? | Direction |
Direction labels: Appreciating / Depreciating / Stable.
With one sentence explaining the classification based on what I said.

4. What decision have I been avoiding? Not "I could do more"–a specific conversation, risk, or commitment I haven't made. (Not just busywork–something I chose because it felt safe.)

5. What's working that you might be neglecting? Something appreciating that isn't getting the investment it deserves.

OUTPUT:
• 2-sentence honest assessment
• The avoided decision + cost of continued avoidance
• One thing working that deserves protection
• One prediction I can verify in 90 days
• What evidence would prove that prediction wrong?
```

## Setup

Use once initially, then annually or when triggered by Re-Setup conditions.

### Output structure:

```
PROBLEM PORTFOLIO

Problem 1: [Name]
• What breaks: [What goes wrong if this isn't solved well]
• Scarcity signals (pick 2):
  - People escalate this to me when it's high-stakes
  - Others can do it, but I'm faster/more trusted
  - I'm the only one who can do it reliably
  - Unknown – [why]
• Direction:
  - AI making it cheaper: [quote my words]
  - Error cost rising/falling: [quote]
  - Trust/context required: [quote]
  - Classification: Appreciating / Depreciating / Stable / Stable (uncertain) – [reason]
• Time allocation: [X]% of my work week

[Repeat for 3-5 problems]

PORTFOLIO HEALTH
• Total appreciating: [X]%
• Total depreciating: [X]%
• Total stable/uncertain: [X]%
• Portfolio risk: [One sentence–where I'm most exposed]
• Portfolio opportunity: [One sentence–where I'm under-investing in appreciation]

BOARD ROLES (anchored to problems)

Core roles (always active):
1. Accountability – anchored to Problem [X]: [specific thing to demand receipts on]
2. Market Reality – anchored to Problem [X]: [specific direction label to challenge]
3. Avoidance – anchored to Problem [X]: [specific decision/conversation to probe]
4. Long-term Positioning – anchored to Problem [X]: [specific 5-year question]
5. Devil's Advocate – anchored to Problem [X]: [specific case against current path]

Growth roles (activate based on portfolio):
6. Portfolio Defender – anchored to Problem [X] (highest appreciating): [specific thing to protect/compound]
7. Opportunity Scout – anchored to Problem [X] (highest appreciating): [specific adjacent skill/opportunity to explore]

RE-SETUP TRIGGERS
Flag for re-setup if any of these occur:
• [Specific condition based on portfolio, e.g., "Role changes," "Coordination problem resolved"]
• [Specific condition, e.g., "AI capability crosses threshold for Problem 2"]
• Annual anniversary of setup (mandatory)
```

### Example:

```
PROBLEM PORTFOLIO

Problem 1: Cross-team coordination
• What breaks: Projects stall when dependencies aren't surfaced early
• Scarcity signals:
  - People escalate this to me when it's high-stakes
  - Others can do it, but I'm faster/more trusted
• Direction:
  - AI making it cheaper: "No–AI doesn't sit in the room and read politics"
  - Error cost rising: "Yes–more teams, more tools, more surface area for failure"
  - Trust/context required: "Yes–I know who actually decides vs. who just talks"
  - Classification: Appreciating – coordination failures are getting more expensive and AI can't do the human-reading part
• Time allocation: 40%

Problem 2: Analysis quality
• What breaks: Leadership makes bad calls when models are wrong
• Scarcity signals:
  - Others can do it, but I'm faster/more trusted
  - Unknown – haven't tested if junior analysts + AI can match my output
• Direction:
  - AI making it cheaper: "Yes–I use Claude to build models 3x faster now"
  - Error cost rising: "Flat–same stakes as before"
  - Trust/context required: "Less than I thought–the model structure is transferable"
  - Classification: Depreciating – production is getting commoditized; I'm competing with AI-assisted juniors
• Time allocation: 30%

Problem 3: Translating analysis to decisions
• What breaks: Good analysis sits unused; leadership doesn't act
• Scarcity signals:
  - People escalate this to me when it's high-stakes
  - I'm the only one who can do it reliably
• Direction:
  - AI making it cheaper: "No–requires reading the room, knowing history, timing"
  - Error cost rising: "Yes–more analysis available means curation matters more"
  - Trust/context required: "Yes–they trust my judgment on what matters"
  - Classification: Appreciating – translation is getting scarcer as analysis gets cheaper
• Time allocation: 20%

Problem 4: Process documentation
• What breaks: Knowledge lost when people leave; repeated mistakes
• Scarcity signals:
  - Others can do it, but I'm faster/more trusted
• Direction:
  - AI making it cheaper: "Yes–AI can draft docs from conversations now"
  - Error cost rising: "Flat–same as before"
  - Trust/context required: "Low–structure is transferable"
  - Classification: Depreciating – AI is genuinely good at this now
• Time allocation: 10%

PORTFOLIO HEALTH
• Total appreciating: 60% (Problems 1, 3)
• Total depreciating: 40% (Problems 2, 4)
• Total stable/uncertain: 0%
• Portfolio risk: 40% of time on depreciating skills. Exposed if I don't shift toward decision-translation.
• Portfolio opportunity: Coordination (40%) is appreciating but I'm not compounding it—no visible artifacts, no reputation-building.

BOARD ROLES

Core roles:
1. Accountability – Problem 2: "You said you'd shift hours from model-building. Show me the calendar."
2. Market Reality – Problem 2: "You labeled this 'depreciating' but you're still spending 30% here. Why?"
3. Avoidance – Problem 1: "You mentioned the timeline conversation. Have you had it?"
4. Long-term Positioning – Problem 3: "If translation is appreciating, what are you doing to become the go-to person for it?"
5. Devil's Advocate – Problem 1: "What if your coordination skill is org-specific and doesn't transfer?"

Growth roles:
6. Portfolio Defender – Problem 1: "Coordination is your highest-appreciating skill. What would cause you to lose your edge? What are you doing to compound it?"
7. Opportunity Scout – Problem 3: "Translation is appreciating. What adjacent skill would 2x its value? Who outside your org is doing interesting work here?"

RE-SETUP TRIGGERS
• Role change or significant scope change
• Problem 2 direction shifts (test whether juniors + AI can match output)
• Any problem exceeds 50% time allocation
• Annual: January 2027
```

### The prompt:

```
You are helping me set up career governance. Ask ONE question at a time. Wait for my answer.

Rule: If my answer is vague, stop and ask for one concrete example before continuing.

BEFORE WE START: Any sensitive details? I'll use abstractions if needed.

PART 1: PROBLEM PORTFOLIO

Help me identify 3-5 problems I'm paid to solve–recurring problems where my judgment determines outcomes.

For each problem, get:
1. What breaks if it isn't solved well
2. Scarcity signals (have me pick 2, or "Unknown + why"):
   - People escalate to me when high-stakes
   - Others can do it, but I'm faster/more trusted
   - I'm the only one who can do it reliably
3. Direction–ask the three questions, then output a table:
   | AI cheaper? | Error cost? | Trust required? |
   Quote my words for each cell. Then classify with one sentence.
   If direction is unclear, label "Stable (uncertain)" and note what evidence next quarter would clarify it.
4. Time allocation–what % of my work week goes to this problem?

GATE: Do not move to Part 2 until 3-5 problems have all fields including time allocation. Push back on vague answers.

After all problems are captured, calculate PORTFOLIO HEALTH:
• Sum time allocation by direction (appreciating/depreciating/stable)
• Identify portfolio risk (where most exposed)
• Identify portfolio opportunity (where under-investing in appreciation)

PART 2: BOARD ROLES

Create 5 core roles + 2 growth roles. Each must be anchored to a specific problem from my portfolio.

Core roles (always active):
• Accountability – what to demand receipts on (anchor to a commitment I made)
• Market Reality – what direction label to challenge (anchor to a classification that might be wrong)
• Avoidance – what decision to probe (anchor to something I'm clearly dodging)
• Long-term Positioning – what 5-year question to ask (anchor to an appreciating problem)
• Devil's Advocate – what case against current path (anchor to my strongest assumption)

Growth roles (anchor to highest-appreciating problem):
• Portfolio Defender – what to protect and compound (what would cause me to lose my edge?)
• Opportunity Scout – what adjacent opportunity to explore (what skill would 2x the value?)

GATE: Each role must reference a specific problem and specific issue. No generic lines. Growth roles must anchor to appreciating problems only.

PART 3: RE-SETUP TRIGGERS

Based on my portfolio, define 2-3 specific conditions that should trigger a re-setup:
• What role/scope change would invalidate this portfolio?
• What market signal would shift a direction classification?
• What time threshold would indicate dangerous drift?
• Include annual mandatory re-setup date (1 year from today)

OUTPUT: PROBLEM PORTFOLIO + PORTFOLIO HEALTH + BOARD ROLES + RE-SETUP TRIGGERS in the format shown.
```

## The Quarterly

Use once per quarter. Paste your Portfolio, Board Roles, and Re-Setup Triggers.

### Receipt Taxonomy:

| Type | Examples | Strength |
|------|----------|----------|
| Decision | Approved plan, documented outcome | Strong |
| Artifact | Shipped doc, merged PR, sent analysis | Strong |
| Calendar | Meeting held, time blocked | Weak alone |
| Proxy | Feedback received, metric moved | Medium |

**Rule:** Calendar-only is weak unless tied to artifact or decision.

### Output structure:

```
QUARTERLY BOARD REPORT – [Quarter, Year]

LAST BET
• Bet: [What I predicted]
• "Wrong if": [What I said would disprove it]
• Result: Happened / Didn't / Partial – [evidence]

COMMITMENTS VS. ACTUALS
• Said: [Commitment]
• Did: [Receipts only–format: "Receipt type – artifact/decision – where it exists"]
• Gap: [What didn't happen]

AVOIDED DECISION
• What: [Specific conversation/risk/conflict]
• Why avoiding: [The discomfort]
• Cost: [What gets worse]

COMFORT WORK
• What: [Something I chose because it let me avoid risk–not just busywork]
• Avoided: [The harder thing]

PORTFOLIO CHECK
• [Problem]: Direction still accurate? Any shift?
• Time allocation shift: [What changed vs. last quarter?]

PORTFOLIO HEALTH UPDATE
• Appreciating: [X]% (was [Y]%)
• Depreciating: [X]% (was [Y]%)
• Trend: Improving / Declining / Stable

PROTECTION CHECK (Portfolio Defender)
• Highest appreciating problem: [Name]
• What I did to compound it: [Receipts]
• What I did to protect my edge: [Receipts]
• Risk of erosion: [Low/Medium/High] – [why]

OPPORTUNITY CHECK (Opportunity Scout)
• Adjacent skill/opportunity identified last quarter: [Name]
• What I explored: [Receipts]
• Signal strength: [Worth pursuing / Too early / Dead end] – [evidence]
• New opportunity to explore: [Name] – [why relevant to appreciating problems]

RE-SETUP TRIGGER CHECK
• Trigger 1: [Condition] – Met? [Yes/No]
• Trigger 2: [Condition] – Met? [Yes/No]
• Trigger 3: [Condition] – Met? [Yes/No]
• Action needed: [None / Schedule re-setup / Immediate re-setup]

NEXT BET
• Bet: [Falsifiable prediction]
• Wrong if: [What would disprove it]
• 90-day checkpoint: [Date]
```

### The prompt:

```
You are running my quarterly board meeting. Produce a BOARD REPORT with every field filled.

I will paste my PROBLEM PORTFOLIO, PORTFOLIO HEALTH, BOARD ROLES, RE-SETUP TRIGGERS, and [if not Q1] last quarter's bet.

GATE 0: If I haven't pasted my PROBLEM PORTFOLIO and BOARD ROLES, stop and ask me to paste them before continuing.

Rule: If my answer is vague, stop and ask for one concrete example or receipt before continuing.

RECEIPT HIERARCHY:
• Decision/Artifact = strong
• Calendar-only = weak (note it)
• Proxy = medium

GATES:
1. Receipts: Challenge vague claims. Quote the receipt type.
2. Avoided decision: Must be specific–a conversation, risk, conflict.
3. Comfort work: Must be something I chose to avoid risk (not just chores). If I say "email" or "meetings," ask: "What harder thing were you avoiding by doing that?"
4. Bet: Must be falsifiable + include "wrong if."
5. Protection: Must show receipts for compounding appreciating skills, not just maintaining them.
6. Opportunity: Must show evidence of exploration, even if just research or conversations.

PROCESS (10 questions):
1. Last bet–what happened? Evidence?
2. Commitments–what receipts?
3. Avoided decision–what, why, cost?
4. Comfort work–what, and what were you avoiding?
5. Portfolio–any direction shifts? Time allocation changes?
6. Portfolio health–is the appreciating/depreciating ratio improving?
7. Protection–what did you do to compound your best skill? What's the erosion risk?
8. Opportunity–what did you explore? What's worth pursuing next?
9. Re-setup triggers–any conditions met?
10. Next bet + what would prove it wrong?

Have ALL board roles ask their anchored questions. Be direct. This includes:
- Core roles challenging gaps and assumptions
- Portfolio Defender asking about protection and compounding
- Opportunity Scout asking about adjacent exploration

OUTPUT: Completed BOARD REPORT with all sections filled.
```

## Re-Setup

Use when any Re-Setup Trigger is met, or annually.

### When to re-setup:

| Trigger Type | Examples | Action |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| **Role change** | Promotion, new job, new team | Full re-setup |
| **Scope change** | Major project ends, new responsibility | Full re-setup |
| **Direction shift** | Problem reclassified in 2+ quarterly reviews | Update that problem + re-anchor affected roles |
| **Time drift** | 20%+ shift in allocation vs. setup | Review portfolio health, consider re-setup |
| **Annual** | 12 months since last setup | Full re-setup |

### The prompt:

```
You are helping me refresh my career governance setup. I will paste my CURRENT portfolio and board roles.

PART 1: REVIEW CURRENT STATE

For each problem in my current portfolio, ask:
1. Is this still a problem I'm paid to solve?
2. Has the direction classification changed based on the last year's evidence?
3. Has my time allocation shifted significantly?

Identify:
• Problems to keep (still relevant, direction unchanged)
• Problems to update (relevant but direction shifted)
• Problems to remove (no longer central to my role)
• Problems to add (new responsibilities or emerging focus areas)

PART 2: REBUILD PORTFOLIO

For any new or significantly changed problems, run the full problem capture:
1. What breaks
2. Scarcity signals
3. Direction (with quotes)
4. Time allocation

Recalculate PORTFOLIO HEALTH.

PART 3: RE-ANCHOR BOARD ROLES

Review each board role:
• Is the anchored problem still in the portfolio?
• Is the specific demand still relevant?
• Should this role anchor to a different problem?

Rebuild any roles that need new anchoring. Ensure:
• Growth roles (Defender, Scout) anchor to current highest-appreciating problems
• No two roles anchor to the same specific issue (diversify the pressure)

PART 4: SET NEW TRIGGERS

Define new re-setup triggers based on updated portfolio.

OUTPUT: Updated PROBLEM PORTFOLIO + PORTFOLIO HEALTH + BOARD ROLES + RE-SETUP TRIGGERS
```

## Role Reference

### Core Roles (Always Active)

| Role | Function | Anchors To | Sample Demand |
|------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Accountability** | Demands receipts for commitments | A specific promise you made | "You said X. Show me the evidence." |
| **Market Reality** | Challenges direction labels | A classification that might be wishful | "You labeled this 'appreciating' but the evidence says..." |
| **Avoidance** | Probes avoided decisions | A conversation/risk you're dodging | "You've mentioned this three quarters in a row. Have you done it?" |
| **Long-term Positioning** | Asks 5-year questions | An appreciating problem | "If this is your future, what are you doing to own more of it?" |
| **Devil's Advocate** | Argues against your path | Your strongest assumption | "What if you're wrong about X?" |

### Growth Roles (Anchor to Appreciating Problems)

| Role | Function | Anchors To | Sample Demand |
|------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Portfolio Defender** | Protects and compounds strengths | Highest-appreciating problem | "What would cause you to lose this edge? What are you doing to compound it?" |
| **Opportunity Scout** | Identifies adjacent opportunities | Highest-appreciating problem | "What adjacent skill would 2x this value? Who's doing interesting work here?" |

## FAQ

**If I don't have receipts:**
That's the answer. "No receipt" is data—we're mapping reality, not grading you.

**If I feel defensive:**
Good. Defensive usually means you're near the avoided decision.

**If I'm neglecting my appreciating skills:**
That's what Portfolio Defender catches. It's easy to focus on fixing weaknesses while your strengths atrophy.

**If I don't know what opportunities to explore:**
That's what Opportunity Scout surfaces. Start with: "What would make my best skill 2x more valuable?"

**If a re-setup trigger fires mid-quarter:**
Note it in your quarterly report. Schedule the re-setup for after the quarterly is complete, unless the trigger is urgent (e.g., you changed jobs).

**When should I use 5 roles vs. 7?**
- 3 problems, clear directions → 5 roles (core only)
- 4-5 problems, mixed directions → 7 roles (add growth roles)
- Growth roles are most valuable when you have at least one clearly appreciating problem worth protecting and compounding
